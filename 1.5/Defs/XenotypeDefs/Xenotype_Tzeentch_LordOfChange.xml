        <label>Lord of Change</label>
        <description>A Lord of Change, also called a "Supreme Mutator," a "Feathered Lord," "The Watching'," and one of the "Eyes of Tzeentch," is an insidious Greater Daemon of Tzeentch, the Chaos God of change and sorcery.

Lords of Change are creatures born from some impossible nightmare, immense bird-like Daemons with shimmering skin, wicked curved beaks and multi-coloured, spectrum-shattering wings.

Those who gaze upon these twisted prisms of pure magic begin to feel their sanity shred and reason slip away. Faced by a being of change incarnate, bedrock beliefs crumble and twist, and the mind seeks firm purchase in vain.</description>
